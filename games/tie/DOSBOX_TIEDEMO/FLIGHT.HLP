MISSION BRIEFING:  
-----------------

for TIE Fighter Group Alpha

Your flight will be responsible for eliminating any opposition
at the Rebel repair yard near Remitik.  In the absence of any 
active defense you will assist in the destruction of the repair
yard.  This is to prepare for an ambush of any ships escaping 
the attack on Hoth.  As Rebel ships enter the area you are to
engage and destroy them.  Take no prisoners!  Good Hunting!


Primary Win Condition:  
----------------------

Destruction of Rebel repair yard and all disabled craft in the area.

Secondary Win Condition:
------------------------

Destruction of all entering Rebel craft except A-wing Rogue.

Bonus Win Condition:
--------------------

Destruction of A-wing Rogue.


MISSION LOG:   
------------

We are all tremendously excited about the upcoming attack.
The Rebels main base has been discovered on the ice planet Hoth.  A
huge assault force is being sent to destroy it.  Our role will be
to support the attack by preparing an ambush for any Rebels that
manage to escape their doom on Hoth.  We are being sent to the
Remitik system to destroy a small repair yard there and wait for
the Rebel vermin to bolt from their holes.

Our starfighters are to be launched from Assassin-class
Corvettes because all of the large capital ships in the sector are
being used at Hoth.  This will be my first real combat mission as
a TIE Fighter pilot.  No more simulators!  
To the glory of the Empire!


COCKPIT INSTRUMENTATION:
------------------------

Target Tracking Display.  The TTD is the main screen at the
bottom of the forward cockpit view.  [O, R, T, U and Y keys]

Immediately above it are an Engine Power Percentage Indicator,
three Threat Warning Lights (duplicated above the gunsight's targeting
box) and a Speed Indicator.

Above these are the right and left Laser Energy Level indicators.

In the lower left is a Hull Integrity Display.

Along the middle left is the Laser Energy Recharge Rate indicator,
and above it is the Mission Elapsed Time Clock.

Along the right is Engine Energy Level indicator, and above it is
the Flight Recorder Display (on/off light and frames remaining.)

In the upper corners are a Forward (on the left) and Rear (right)
Sensor Display.  The dots indicate other craft.  They are color coded:
red for Imperial, green for Rebel, and yellow for missiles and torpedoes.
The brightness of the dot is also an indication of the distance (near - 
bright, far - faint.)  The dot representing whatever is targeted in the TTD
will have white brackets around it.


A BRIEF NOTE ON TACTICS:
------------------------

TIE Fighters have no shields!  The hull can only withstand a few hits.
Watch out for friendly fire.  Although, it is certainly effective to gang up
on a single target to overwhelm it, there is great risk involved.  Avoid flying
between a wingman and his target.  Keep an eye on the Laser Energy Level,
the brighter green that indicates "turboblast" strength will dissipate quickly
with constant fire.  Be sure to set your recharge rate at maximum whenever
you can.


A HINT FOR WINNING THE MISSION:
-------------------------------

Keep an eye out for the Rebel Freighters.  They don't stay for long, so you
have to get them quickly.
